<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Mr. Bryce</span> has for a long time been a man of
international prominence. His wide influence
is undoubtedly due to many causes, but it may,
in general, be traced to two characteristics:
Mr. Bryce is a humanist who sympathetically
watches the progress of nations and the guiding
of governments; he is also a historian. In his
biographical study of John Richard Green he
has skillfully analyzed the aptitudes of the
historian, and in so doing has pointedly, if
unwittingly, described himself. Accuracy, he
says,—a desire for the exact truth,—keen
observation, sound judgment, imagination,
and, following inevitably from these, command
of literary exposition, are the powers which a
historian needs. Each of these qualities Mr.
Bryce himself possesses in large measure. It is
his historical power, enabling him to observe
and record the significant phases and events of
human life, plus his sympathetic interest in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
present-day manifestations which explain, in
some degree, his singularly eminent position
as an authority on matters pertaining to human
institutions in various countries.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryce was born in northern Ireland in
1838, of Scotch-Irish parents; and he combines
in his nature the stalwart intellectual propensities
of the Scot and the artistic attributes of
the Celt. He was educated at the University
of Glasgow, and later went to Oxford where
he won many honors. After finishing his collegiate
work he was admitted to the bar and
practiced law in London until 1882. At the
age of thirty-two he was appointed Regius
Professor of Civil Law at Oxford. Up to this
point his life had been almost exclusively that
of a student and a scholar; and already at this
time he was recognized as a man of remarkable
historical ability. The year 1880 marked a
change in his life. He presented himself to the
workingmen of Tower Hamlets, London, as a
candidate for a seat in the House of Commons.
Mr. Stead tells us that Mr. Bryce, in this first
campaign, addressed his open-air audiences
somewhat after the manner of a professor lecturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
in a classroom; he succeeded, nevertheless,
in getting himself elected, and for over
twenty-five years thereafter was a member of
Parliament. During these years he held various
responsible offices having to do with home
and foreign administrative work. The practical
results of his political influence were
advancement in public education, the securing
of more extensive parks and open country
spaces for the pleasure of the poorer classes,
and the furtherance of international peace. In
1907, Mr. Bryce was appointed ambassador
to the United States, which office he resigned
in 1913 to carry on literary work.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryce’s knowledge is the result not only
of university training and experience in public
life, but also of varied reading. He has read
art, science, history, and has always been an
interested student of poetry. In speaking once
to Americans of Swinburne, he suddenly
paused and asked, “Who are writing your
songs and stirring your heart,—or isn’t your
heart being stirred? Nothing is more important
than that each generation and each land
should have its poets. Each oncoming tide of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
life, each age, requires and needs men of lofty
thought who shall dream and sing for it, who
shall gather up its tendencies and formulate
its ideals and voice its spirit, proclaiming its
duties and awakening its enthusiasm, through
the high authority of the poet and the art of his
verse.” How extensively Mr. Bryce has read
the poets, both ancient and modern, one perceives
from the references and allusions in his
<cite>Studies in Contemporary Biography</cite>.</p>

<p>The most important source of Mr. Bryce’s
knowledge, the one which has furnished the
material for nearly all his books, has been his
first-hand observation and study of many
countries. When still a young man he wandered
alone over Mount Ararat, since the native
guides refused to follow him to the unknown
wilds of that lonely peak. He visited the
Ottoman Empire in 1876, and, as a result of
his investigations there, became an advocate
of the Bulgarian cause; in fact it was his
speeches on the Eastern Question which first
made him prominent politically. Mr. Bryce
has traveled also in Iceland; he was in Africa
just previous to the Boer War; he has been all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
over South America; and he knows the United
States as few Americans know it. He has
studied these countries with great faithfulness,
observing keenly every phase of the political
and social life. An interesting sample of his
method of gathering information is found in
the chapter on “The Position of Women” in
<cite>The American Commonwealth</cite>. When traveling
in the West he noticed that all of the women
seemed so very well dressed that apparently
none could be the wife or daughter of a workingman;
but close observation dispelled this
illusion. Idling in a bookstore one day in
Oregon, he noticed a woman who was asking
for a certain magazine. After her departure
he asked the salesman who she was, and found
that she was the wife of a workman, and the
magazine a Paris fashion journal. “This,” says
Mr. Bryce, “set me to observing female dress
more closely, and it turned out to be perfectly
true that the women in these little towns were
following the Parisian fashions very closely,
and were, in fact, ahead of the majority of
English ladies belonging to the professional
and mercantile classes.” Thus no detail, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
trivial, escapes him; the pleasant and
unpleasant phases of our American life, our
manners, clothes, scenery have all been noted
and reckoned with in the statement of tendencies
and conclusions.</p>

<p>As a parliamentarian Mr. Bryce is said to
have been direct, honest, and always illuminating.
His ability to command attention was
due not to any great oratorical gift, but rather
to his scholarly view of any matter under
debate. Mr. Justin McCarthy reports that the
members of the House who might be dining,
smoking, or reading in the rooms assigned for
these purposes, would, when the news was
passed around that Mr. Bryce was speaking,
leave these pleasant diversions, and betake
themselves with great speed to the debating
chamber. “I have many a time,” he says,
“heard Conservative members murmur, in
tones not altogether expressing absolute satisfaction
at the disturbing information, ‘Bryce
is up—I must go in and hear what he has to
say.’ ... Everybody knows that when he
speaks it is because he has something to say
which ought to be spoken and therefore ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
to be heard.” Mr. Bryce was able to command
attention also because of his reputation as a
courageous nonpartisan. He never advocated
a measure or policy for mere party reasons or
for personal aggrandizement. Not infrequently
he has fought bravely with the minority of his
own party, and has at times suffered bitter
attacks, as when he remained resolutely pro-Boer
during the rampant jingoism of the
South African War. But however widely political
enemies might differ from him, they respected
his sincerity and his luminous view of
governmental problems. It is further characteristic
of Mr. Bryce’s public life that he never,
in his desire for the welfare of his own country,
lost sight of what is due other nations. In
practice as well as in precept he upheld the
doctrine that “patriotism consists not in
waving a flag, but in striving that our country
shall be righteous as well as strong.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bryce’s books deal, for the most part,
with historical subjects and present-day governments.
<cite>The Holy Roman Empire</cite>, written when
he was only twenty-four years old, is still
regarded by able historians as an accurate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
authoritative work; and, in the judgment of
literary critics, it is written with so much
charm of style that it is destined to become an
English classic. All of the books which have
to do with foreign nations are characterized by
a tactful, faithful, and above all a truthful,
handling. It was <cite>The American Commonwealth</cite>
which made the citizens of the United States
regard Mr. Bryce as a friend of the Republic;
but he is not so regarded because he has always
stroked the gleaming pinions of the American
eagle. Although he does seem to share the hope
universally cherished by Americans that we
shall, in spite of grave national defects, “win
out” in the end, he has nevertheless, in direct
and unadorned statements, pointed out our
faults. As an example of his characteristic
straightforwardness of speech, take the following
sentence: “America has little occasion to
think of foreign affairs, but some of her domestic
difficulties are such as to demand that careful
observation and unbroken reflection which
neither her executive magistrates, nor her
legislatures, nor any leading class among her
people now give.” Mr. Bryce has never ceased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
to insist that America suffers from lack of
honest, courageous leadership in dealing with
such problems as municipal evils and the insidious
influence of “vested interests.” Our heedlessness
and indifference to public matters is
our national sin, but Mr. Bryce foresees a cure
for our defects in the increasing zeal with
which the younger generation is assuming the
public burden; but how great must be its zeal
and how steady its purpose if anything is to be
accomplished, one is made poignantly aware
by reading the account of the Tammany Ring
in <cite>The American Commonwealth</cite>.</p>

<p>When a man of Mr. Bryce’s ability and
experience points out definitely the chief
obstacles to good citizenship and furthermore
indicates the means by which these may be
overcome, one may be as sure that he will say
something which should be heeded as were the
members of the House when he was a parliamentarian.
In 1909, Mr. Bryce gave at Yale
University a series of lectures which were later
published by the Yale University Press under
the title <cite>Hindrances to Good Citizenship</cite>. The
main obstacles to good citizenship are defined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
as indolence, private self-interest, and party
spirit.</p>

<p>The first lecture, “Indolence,” brings to mind
the chapter in <cite>The American Commonwealth</cite>
on “The War Against Bossdom,” with its
vigorous concluding words, “In America, as
everywhere else in the world, the commonwealth
suffers more often from apathy or
shortsightedness in the upper classes, who
ought to lead, than from ignorance or recklessness
in the humbler classes, who generally are
ready to follow when wisely led.”</p>

<p>In the second lecture, “Private Self-Interest,”
Mr. Bryce states the causes which produce
a body of citizens who care more about
their own advancement than about the welfare
of the country. The most important of
these causes are tariff issues, appropriations
of public money for local interests, governmental
contracts, public officeholding,—all
representing “the insidious power of money
which knows how to play upon the self-interest
of voters and legislators, polluting at its source
the spring of Civic Duty.”</p>

<p>The third lecture considers party spirit as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
a hindrance to citizenship. Mr. Bryce acknowledges
the practical necessity for parties in
the management of popular governments, and
also the perplexing difficulties of a party
leader who must decide between conscience
and party. There is nevertheless but one
course open to him: he must follow his conscience;
only he must carefully distinguish between
conscience and angular independence
which is lacking in common sense and in willingness
to defer to others in unimportant matters.
For the average man the question is a
simple one; relieved of the burdens of party
leadership, he should follow his intelligence
rather than his party. A large number of independent
voters secures most effectively the
right administration of public business.</p>

<p>The last lecture in the series, “How to
Overcome the Obstacles to Good Citizenship,”
suggests various means by which a more satisfactory
body of citizens may be secured. In
method and style this lecture is illustrative
of the author’s peculiar strength in exposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryce’s writings are remarkable for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
lucid organization of a wealth of detail into
significant principles and sound conclusions;
for vividness in the presentation of whatever
pertains to humanity, and for gracious, winning
English. One finds always in his work
simplicity in the unfolding of material which
has been carefully gathered and calmly judged.
There is perfect clarity in the handling of a
mass of detail, and such skillful subordination
of it and masterly emphasis of important principles
that the reader easily catches the bearing
on the central thought of every illustration or
description. There is also in the writing a
solidity and firmness, a bracing stalwartness—qualities
which are the result of the writer’s
own sturdy nature. But this is not all. The
author’s almost novelistic power of seeing persons
and things makes his writing as vivid as
a story; even his most abstract propositions are
tangible and real. And the material is, moreover,
so sympathetically and earnestly treated
that it is at times lifted above mere pedestrian
exposition and becomes warm with the feeling
of the writer. The everyday words and unadorned
sentences, infused with the spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
the one who writes, become potent to stir
slumbering ideals. Suddenly over the level
way of mere intellectual matters falls a dreamy
light, a Celtic graciousness of manner; and the
reader no longer journeys along a mere brown
path, but sees the familiar scenes of the way
idealized by the touch of poetry. The value of
skillful exposition as an asset for leadership,
or for the accomplishment of any other purpose,
Mr. Bryce fully appreciates. A command
of language is a power possessed by nearly
every one of the men, eminent in the nineteenth
century, whom Mr. Bryce describes in
his <cite>Studies in Contemporary Biography</cite>. By
means of it Mr. John Richard Green wrote the
most brilliant history of modern times; through
the stirring editorials of the <cite>Nation</cite>, Mr.
Godkin was able to arouse an indifferent
American public to a more earnest consideration
of the national welfare; and it was Mr.
Gladstone’s gift of “noble utterance” which
more than any other talent enabled him for
many years to hold an authoritative political
position. Mr. Bryce’s own rare power as a
writer of vigorous, persuasive English is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
the qualities which has made him in a certain
sense a citizen of the world with an almost
world-wide influence.</p>

<p>However helpful Mr. Bryce’s method may
be for the student who is attempting to understand
and master the technique of successful
English, it is the subject-matter which is primarily
of importance. It is valuable for the
student since it may serve to stimulate the
investigation and expression of certain questions
connected with the administration of
public matters in his own town or city; and it
may also suggest the explanation and judgment
of measures proposed to secure better government,
such as the Referendum. But the essential
worth of the material lies in the fact that it
is a tonic for relaxed vigilance in public affairs.
It would be well to require every citizen of
the United States to read in school days <cite>The
American Commonwealth</cite>; one ventures to say
that there would be, as a result, a steady advancement
in the right understanding and fulfillment
of civic duties; but even a limited
acquaintance with Mr. Bryce should serve to
define in clearer terms the elements of a sane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xii</span>
and effective patriotism. And Mr. Bryce’s own
life, unfalteringly and resolutely devoted to a
just administration of governments, together
with its unfailing graciousness in the most trying
situations, furnishes an invigorating example
of the truly successful statesman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INDOLENCE">INDOLENCE</h2>

<p><span class="firstword">Dr. Samuel Johnson</span>, being once asked how
he came to have made a blunder in his famous
English Dictionary, is reported to have
answered, “Ignorance, Sir, sheer ignorance.”
Whoever has grown old enough to look back
over the wasted opportunities of life—and we
all of us waste more opportunities than we use—will
be apt to ascribe most of his blunders to
sheer indolence. Sometimes one has omitted
to learn what it was needful to learn in order to
proceed to action; sometimes one has shrunk
from the painful effort required to reflect and
decide on one’s course, leaving it to Fortune to
settle what Will ought to have settled; sometimes
one has, from mere self-indulgent sluggishness,
let the happy moment slip.</p>

<p>The difference between men who succeed
and men who fail is not so much as we commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
suppose due to differences in intellectual
capacity. The difference which counts for
most is that between activity and slackness;
between the man who, observing alertly and
reflecting incessantly, anticipates contingencies
before they occur, and the lazy, easy-going,
slowly-moving man who is roused with difficulty,
will not trouble himself to look ahead,
and so being taken unprepared loses or misuses
the opportunities that lead to fortune. If it be
true that everywhere, though perhaps less here
than in European countries, energy is the exception
rather than the rule, we need not wonder
that men show in the discharge of civic duty the
defects which they show in their own affairs.
No doubt public affairs demand only a small
part of their time. But the spring of self-interest
is not strong where public affairs are
concerned. The need for activity is not continuously
present. A duty shared with many others
seems less of a personal duty. If a hundred, a
thousand, ten thousand other citizens are as
much bound to speak, vote, or act as each one
of us is, the sense of obligation becomes to each
of us weak. Still weaker does it become when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
one perceives the neglect of others to do their
duty. The need for the good citizen’s action,
no doubt, becomes then all the greater. But
it is only the best sort of citizen that feels it to
be greater. The Average Man judges himself
by the average standard and does not see why
he should take more trouble than his neighbours.
Thus we arrive at a result summed up
in the terrible dictum, which reveals the basic
fault of democracy, “What is Everybody’s
business is Nobody’s business.”</p>

<p>Of indolence, indifference, apathy, in general,
no more need be said. It is a sin that easily
besets us all. We might suppose that where
public affairs are concerned it would decrease
under the influence of education and the press.
But several general causes have tended to increase
it in our own generation, despite the
increasing strength of the appeal which civic
duty makes to men who are, or if they cared
might be, better informed about public affairs
than were their fathers.</p>

<p>The first of these causes is that manners have
grown gentler and passions less angry. A chief
duty of the good citizen is to be angry when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
anger is called for, and to express his anger by
deeds, to attack the bad citizen in office, or
otherwise in power, to expose his dishonesty, to
eject him from office, to brand him with an
ignominy which will prevent his returning to
any post of trust. In former days indignation
flamed higher, and there was little tenderness
for offenders. Jehu smote the prophets of Baal.
Bad ministers—and no doubt sometimes good
ministers also—were in England beheaded
on Tower Hill. Everywhere punishment came
quicker and was more severe, though to be
sure it was often too harsh. Nowadays the
arm of justice is often arrested by an indulgence
which forgets that the true aim of punishment
is the protection of the community. The very
safeguards with which our slower and more
careful procedure has surrounded trials and
investigations, proper as such safeguards are
for the security of the innocent, have often so
delayed the march of justice that when a conviction
has at last been obtained, the offence
has begun to be forgotten and the offender
escapes with a trifling penalty, or with none.
This is an illustration of the principle that as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
righteous indignation is a valuable motive
power in politics, the decline in it means a
decline either in the standard of virtue or in the
standard of zeal, possibly in both.</p>

<p>Another cause may be found in the fact that
the enormous growth of modern states has
made the share in government of the individual
citizen seem infinitesimally small. In an average
Greek republic, he was one of from two
to ten thousand voters. In England or France
to-day he is one of many millions. The chance
that his vote will make any difference to the
result is so slender that it appears to him
negligible. We are proud, and justly proud, of
having adapted free government to areas far
vaster than were formerly thought capable of
receiving free institutions. It was hoped that
the patriotism of the citizen would expand
with the magnitude of the State. But this did
not happen in Rome, the greatest of ancient
republics. Can we say that it has happened in
the modern world? Few of us realize that
though our own share may be smaller our
responsibility increases with the power our
State exerts. The late Professor Henry Sidgwick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
once travelled from Davos in the easternmost
corner of Switzerland to the town of
Cambridge in England and back again to
deliver his vote against Home Rule at the
general election of 1886, though he knew that
his own side would have a majority in the constituency.
Those who knew applauded, his
opponents included, but I fear that few of us
followed this shining example of civic virtue.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the highest, because the most difficult,
duty of a citizen is to fight valiantly for
his convictions when he is in a minority. The
smaller the minority, and the more unpopular
it is, and the more violent are the attacks upon
it, so much the louder is the call of duty to defend
one’s opinions. To withstand the “ardor
civium prava iubentium”—to face “the
multitude hasting to do evil”—this is the
note and the test of genuine virtue and courage.
Now this is, or seems to be, a more formidable
task the vaster the community becomes.
It is harder to make your voice heard
against the roar of ocean than against the
whistling squall that sweeps down over a
mountain lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>Lastly, there has been within the last century
a great accession to our knowledge of
nature, a more widely diffused and developed
interest in literature and art as well as in
science. This development, in itself fraught
with laudable means of enjoyment, has had
the unforeseen yet natural result of reducing
the interest in public affairs among the educated
classes, while the ardour with which
competitions in physical strength and skill are
followed has in like manner diverted the
thoughts and attention of the less educated—and
indeed, not of them alone but of many also
in a class from whom better things might have
been expected. Politics, in fact, have nowadays
to strive against more rival subjects attracting
men’s eyes and minds than they had before
scientific discovery and art, and above all,
athletic sports, came to fill newspapers and
magazines.</p>

<p>But so far from being less important than
they were, politics are growing in every country
more important the wider the sphere of
governmental action becomes. Nevertheless,
even in England, which is perhaps slightly less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
addicted to this new passion for looking on at
and reading about athletic competitions than
are North America and Australia, a cricket or
football match or a horse-race seems, if one
may judge by the eager throngs that snatch the
evening newspapers, to excite more interest in
the middle as well as in the richer and in the
upper section of the poorer classes than does
any political event.</p>

<p>How to overcome these adverse tendencies is
a question which I reserve till the last of these
lectures. Meantime, let us look at some of the
forms in which indifference to the obligations
of citizenship reveals itself.</p>

<p>The first duty of the citizen used to be to
fight, and to fight not merely against foes from
another State, but against those also who,
within his own State, were trying to overturn
the Constitution or resist the laws. It is a
duty still incumbent on us all, though the
existence of soldiers and a police force calls us
to it less frequently. The omission to take up
arms in a civil strife was a grave offence in the
republics of antiquity, where revolutions were
frequent, as they are to-day in some of the states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of Latin America. When respectable people
stayed at home instead of taking sword and
spear to drive out the adherents of an adventurer
trying to make himself Tyrant, they gave
the adventurer his chance: and in any case
their abstention tended to prolong a civil war
which would end sooner when it was seen which
way the bulk of the people inclined. There was
accordingly a law in some of the Greek republics
that every citizen must take one side or the
other in an insurrection. If he did not, he was
liable to punishment. I have not heard of any
one being indicted in England or the United
States for failing to discharge his legal duty to
join in the hue and cry after a thief, or to rally
to the sheriff when he calls upon the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">posse comitatus</i>
to support him in maintaining law and
order. But possibly an indictment would still
lie; and in England we have within recent
times enrolled bodies of special constables from
the civil population to aid in maintaining public
tranquillity.</p>

<p>More peaceful times have substituted for the
duty of fighting the duty of voting. But even
in small communities the latter duty has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
often neglected. In Athens the magistrates
used to send round the Scythian bowmen, who
acted as their police, to scour the streets with a
rope coloured with vermilion, and drag towards
the Pnyx (the place of assembly), citizens who
preferred to lounge or to mind what they called
their own business, as if ruling the State was
not their business. So in modern Switzerland
some cantons have enacted laws fining those
who, without reasonable excuse, neglect to
vote.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This is the more remarkable because the
Swiss have a good record in the matter of voting,
better, I think, than any other European
people. Such a law witnesses not to exceptional
negligence but to an exceptionally high standard
of duty. In Britain we sometimes bring to
the polls at a parliamentary election eighty,
or even more than eighty, per cent of our registered
electors, which is pretty good when it is
remembered that the register may have been
made up eleven months earlier, so that many
electors are sure to have moved elsewhere. At
elections for local authorities a much smaller
proportion vote; and I fancy, though I have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
figures at hand, that in France, Belgium, and
still more in Italy the percentage voting at all
sorts of elections is less than in Switzerland or
in Britain. The number who vote does not
perfectly measure the personal sense of duty
among electors, because an efficient party organization
may, like the Scythian bowmen,
sweep voters who do not care but who can be
either driven to the polls or paid to go. Unless
it is money that takes the voters there, it is well
that they should go; for it helps to form the
habit.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This example has, I believe, been followed in Belgium.</p>

</div>

<p>Another form of civic apathy is the reluctance
to undertake civic functions. In England
this is not discoverable in any want of candidates
for Parliament. They abound, though
sometimes the fittest men prefer ease or business
success to public life. But seats upon local
authorities and especially upon municipal
councils and district councils, seldom attract
the best ability of the local community. In
English and Scottish cities the leading commercial,
financial, and professional men do not
often appear as candidates, leaving the work to
persons who are not indeed incompetent, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
usually intelligent business men, but whose
education and talents are sometimes below the
level of the functions which these bodies discharge.
No great harm has followed, because
our city councillors are almost always honest.
Local public opinion is vigilant and exacting,
so a high standard of probity is maintained.
But municipalities have latterly embarked on
so many kinds of new work, and the revenues
of the greater cities have so grown, that not
merely business capacity and experience, but a
large grasp of economic principles is required.
This is no less true here in America, yet I gather
that here it is found even more difficult than in
Europe to secure the presence of able administrators
in city councils.</p>

<p>A man engaged in a large business who takes
up municipal work may doubtless find that he
is making a pecuniary sacrifice. But if he has
already an income sufficient for his comfort,
may it not be his best way of serving his fellow-men?</p>

<p>Many such men do serve as governors or
trustees of educational or other public institutions
which make nearly as great a demand on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
their time as the membership of a public body
would. Others, in Europe, if less frequently
here, give to amusement much more of their
leisure than the needs of recreation and health
require. This is often due rather to thoughtlessness
than to a conscious indifference to the
call of duty.</p>

<p>Some of your political reformers have dwelt
on the difficulties which party organizations,
specially powerful in the United States, place
in the way of educated and public-spirited men
seeking to enter politics. There may be truth
in this as regards the lower districts of the
larger cities, but one can scarcely think it generally
true even of the cities. More frequently
it is alleged that the work of local politics is
disagreeable, bringing a man into contact with
vulgar people and exposing him to misrepresentation
and abuse.</p>

<p>This is an excuse for abstention which ought
never to be heard in a democratic country. If
politics are anywhere vulgar, they ought not
to be suffered to remain vulgar, as they will
remain if the better educated citizens keep
aloof. They involve the highest interests of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
nation or the city. The way in which they are
handled is a lesson to the people either in honesty
or in knavery. The best element in a
community cannot afford to let its interests be
the sport of self-seekers or rogues. Moreover,
the loss by maladministration or robbery,
large as it may sometimes be, is a less serious
evil than is the damage to public morals. If
those who have the manners and speak the
language of educated men refuse to enter
practical politics, they must cease to complain
of a want of refinement in politics. In reality,
good manners are the best way in which to
meet rudeness; and he who is too thin-skinned
to disregard abuse confesses his own want of
manliness. The mass of the people, even those
who are neither educated nor fastidious, know
honesty when they see it, and discount such
abuse. When a man is firm and upright,
nothing better braces him up and fits him to
serve his country than to be attacked on the
platform or in the press for faults he has not
committed. It puts him on his mettle. It
toughens his fibre. It gives him self-control
and teaches him how to do right in the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
which is least exposed to misrepresentation. It
nerves his courage for the far more difficult
trials which come when friends as well as opponents
censure him because honour and obedience
to his conscience have required him to
take an unpopular line and speak unwelcome
truths. A little persecution for righteousness’
sake is a wholesome thing.</p>

<p>The deficient sense of civic duty, though
most frequently noted in the form of a neglect
to vote, is really more general and serious in the
neglect to think. Were it possible to have statistics
to show what percentage of those who
vote reflect upon the vote they have to give,
there would in no country be found a large
percentage. Yet what is the worth of a vote
except as the expression of a considered opinion?
The act of marking a ballot is nothing
unless the mark carries with it a judgment, the
preference of a good candidate to a bad one,
the approval of one policy offered the people,
the rejection of another. The citizen owes it
to the community to inform himself about the
questions submitted for his decision, and weigh
the arguments on each side; or if the issue be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
one rather of persons than of policies, to learn
all he can regarding the merits of the candidates
offered to his choice.</p>

<p>How many voters really trouble themselves
to do this? One in five? One in ten? One in
twenty?</p>

<p>It may be asked, How can they do it? What
means have they of studying public questions
and reaching just conclusions? If the means are
wanting, can we blame them if they do not
think? If they feel they do not understand,
can we blame them if they do not vote? In
every free country the suffrage is now so wide
that the great majority of the voters have to
labour for their daily bread. In most European
countries many are imperfectly educated. In
the rural districts they read with difficulty,
see either no newspaper or one which helps
them but little, lead isolated lives in which
there are scanty opportunities for learning what
passes, so that the best they can do seems to
be to ask advice from the priest, or the village
schoolmaster, or take advice from their landlord
or their employer. In the northern parts
of the United States and also in Canada, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
native population has indeed received a fair
instruction, and reads newspapers; but the
mass of voters is swelled by a crowd of recent
immigrants, most of whom cannot read English
and know nothing of your institutions.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, in modern countries ruled
by universal suffrage the Average Citizen has
not the means of adequately discharging the
function which the constitution throws upon
him of following, examining, and judging
those problems of statesmanship which the
ever-growing range of government administration
and the ever-increasing complexity of
our civilization set before him as a voter to
whom issues of policy are submitted.</p>

<p>As things stand, he votes, when he votes, not
from knowledge, but as his party or his favourite
newspaper bids him, or according to his
predilection for some particular leader. Unless
it be held that every man has a natural and
indefeasible right to a share in the government
of the country in which he resides, the ground
for giving that share would seem to be the competence
of the recipient and the belief that his
sharing will promote the general welfare. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
one may almost say that the theory of universal
suffrage assumes that the Average Citizen is an
active, instructed, intelligent ruler of his country.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
The facts contradict this assumption.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> It may no doubt be argued that even if he is not competent,
it is better he should be within than without the voting class.
But this was not the ground generally taken by those who brought
in universal suffrage.</p>

</div>

<p>Does this mean that widely extended suffrage
is a failure, and that the Average Man is not a
competent citizen in a democracy?</p>

<p>This question brings us to reflect on another
branch of civic duty not yet mentioned. Besides
the civic duties already described of
Fighting, Voting, and Thinking, there is another
duty. It is the duty of Mutual Help, the
duty incumbent on those who possess, through
their knowledge and intelligence, the capacity
of Instruction and Persuasion to advise and to
guide their less competent fellow-citizens. No
sensible man ought ever to have supposed that
under such conditions as large modern communities
present, the bulk of the citizens could
vote wisely from their own private knowledge
and intelligence. Even in small cities, such as
was Sicyon in the days of Aratus, or Boston in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the days of James Otis, the Average Man
needed the help of his more educated and
wiser neighbours. While communities remained
small, it was easy to get this help. But now the
swift and vast growth of states and cities has
changed everything. Private talk counts for
less when the richer citizens dwell apart from
the poorer; their opportunities of meeting are
fewer, and there is less friendliness, if also less
dependence, in the relation of the employed to
the employer. Public meetings do not give
nearly all that the Average Man needs, not
to add that being got together to present one
set of facts and arguments and deliberately to
ignore the other, they do not put him in a fair
position to judge. Besides, the men who most
need instruction are usually those who least
come to meetings to receive it.</p>

<p>To fill this void the newspapers have arisen,—organs
purporting to supply the materials
required for the formation of political opinion.
Whatever the services of the newspaper in
other respects, it has the inevitable defect of
superseding, with most of those who read it,
the exercise of independent thought. The newspaper—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
speak generally, for there are some
brilliant exceptions—is, in Europe even more
than here, almost always partisan in its views,
often partisan in its selection of facts or at least
in its way of stating them. Presenting one side
of a case, addressing chiefly those who are
already adherents of that side, putting a
colour on the events it reports,—it serves up
to the reader ideas, perhaps only mere phrases
or catchwords, which confirm him in his prepossessions,
and by its daily iteration makes
him take them for truths. Seldom has he the
leisure, still more seldom the impulse or the
patience, to scrutinize these ideas for himself
and form his own judgment. He is glad to be
relieved of the necessity for thinking, because
thinking is hard work. Indolence again! The
habit of mind that is formed by hasty reading,
and especially by the reading of newspapers
and magazines in which the matter, excellent
as parts of it often are, is so multifarious that
one topic diverts attention from the others,
tends to a general dissipation and distraction
of thought. It is a habit which tells upon us all
and makes continuous reflection and a critical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
or logical treatment of the subjects deserving
reflection more irksome to us in the full sunlight
of to-day than it was to those whom we call our
benighted ancestors.</p>

<p>This is only one form of that supersession of
the practice of thinking by the vice commonly
called “the reading habit” which is profoundly
affecting the intellectual life of our time. Yet
as steady thinking was never really common
even among the educated, the difference from
earlier days is not so correctly described by
saying that people think less than formerly, as
by noting that while people read more, and
while far more people read, the ratio of thinking
to reading does not increase either in the
individual or in the mass, and may possibly
be decreasing. Intelligence and independence
of thought have not grown in proportion to the
diffusion of knowledge. The number of persons
who both read and vote is in England and
France more than twenty times as great as it
was seventy years ago. The percentage of those
who reflect before they vote has not kept pace
either with popular education or with the
extension of the suffrage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>The persons who constitute that percentage
are, and must for the reasons already given
continue for some time to be, only a fraction,
in some countries a small fraction, of the voting
population. But the fraction might be made
much larger than it is. The citizens who stand
above their fellows in knowledge and mental
power ought to set an example, not only by
themselves thinking more and thinking harder
about public affairs than most of them do, but
also by exerting themselves to stimulate and aid
their less instructed or more listless neighbours.
The voter, it is said, should be independent.
Yes. But independence does not mean isolation.
He must not commit his personal responsibility
to the keeping of another. Yes. But
personal responsibility does not mean the vain
conceit of knowledge and judgment where
knowledge is wanting and judgment is untrained.</p>

<p>Just as his religion throws upon every Christian
the duty of loving his neighbour and giving
practical expression to his love by helping
his neighbour, succouring him in the hour of
need, trying to rescue him from sin, seeking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
guide his steps into the way of peace, so civic
duty requires each of us to raise the level of
citizenship not merely by ourselves voting and
bearing a share in political agitation, but by
trying to diffuse among our fellow-citizens
whose opportunities have been less favourable,
the knowledge and the fairness of mind and the
habit of grappling with political questions
which a democratic government must demand
even from the Average Man. Democracy, they
say, is based on Equality. But in no form of
government is leadership so essential. A multitude
without intelligent, responsible leaders
whom it respects and follows is a crowd ready
to become the prey of any self-seeking knave.
Nor is it true that because men value equality
they reject eminence. They are always glad
to be led if some one, eschewing pretension and
condescension, speaking to them with respect,
but also with that authority which knowledge
and capacity imply, will point out the path and
give them the lead for which they are looking.
To do this has now, in our great cities, become
more difficult than it used to be, because men
of different classes and different occupations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
do not know one another as well as they once
did, and economic conflicts have made workingmen
suspicious. But there are those in our
English and Scottish cities who do it successfully,
and I have never heard that it is resented.
It is largely a matter of tact, and of knowing
how to express that genuine sense of human
fellowship which is commoner in the richer
class than the constraint and shyness that are
supposed to beset Englishmen sometimes allow
to appear.</p>

<p>If you and we, both here and in Britain, are
less active than we should be in this and other
forms of civic work, the fault lies in our not
caring enough for our country. It is easy to
wave a flag, to cheer an eminent statesman, to
exult in some achievement by land or sea. But
our imaginations are too dull to realize either
the grandeur of the State in its splendid opportunities
for promoting the welfare of the masses,
or the fact that the nobility of the State lies
in its being the true child, the true exponent,
of the enlightened will of a right-minded and
law-abiding people. Absorbed in business or
pleasure, we think too little of what our membership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
in a free nation means for the happiness
of our poorer fellow-citizens. The eloquent
voice of a patriotic reformer sometimes breaks
our slumber. But the daily round of business
and pleasure soon again fills the mind, and
public duty fades into the background of life.
This dulness of imagination and the mere
indolence which makes us neglect to stop and
think, are a chief cause of that indifference
which chokes the growth of civic duty. It is
because a great University like this is the place
where the imagination of young men may best
be quickened by the divine fire, because the
sons of a great University are those who may
best carry with them into after life the inspiration
which history and philosophy and poetry
have kindled within its venerable walls, that
I have ventured to dwell here on the special
duty which those who enjoy these privileges
owe to their brethren, partners in the citizenship
of a great republic.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_TO_OVERCOME_THE_OBSTACLES_TO_GOOD_CITIZENSHIP">HOW TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES TO GOOD CITIZENSHIP</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> the preceding three lectures<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> the chief
hindrances to the discharge of civic duty have
been considered. Let us now go on to inquire
what can be done to remove these hindrances
by grappling with those faults or weaknesses
in the citizen to which they are due. When
symptoms have been examined, one looks about
for remedies.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The two lectures reprinted in this volume are the first and
last of a series of four given by Mr. Bryce at Yale University.</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that of the three causes assigned,
Indolence, Selfish Personal Interest,
and Party Spirit, the first is the most common,
the second the most noxious, the third the most
excusable, yet also the most subtle, and perhaps
the most likely to affect the class which
takes the lead in politics and is incessantly
employed upon its daily work. Whether the
influence of these causes, or of any of them, is
increasing with that more complete democratization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
of government which we see going on in
Europe, is a question that cannot yet be answered.
Fifty years may be needed before
it can be answered, for new tendencies both
for good and for evil are constantly emerging
and affecting one another in unpredictable
ways.</p>

<p>The remedies that may be applied to any
defects in the working of governments are
some of them Mechanical, some of them Ethical.
By Mechanical remedies I understand
those which consist in improving the structure
or the customs and working devices of government,
i. e., the laws and the institutions or
political methods, by Ethical those which
affect the character and spirit of the people.
If you want to get more work and better work
done in any industry, you may either improve
the machinery, or the implements, by which
the work is done, or else improve the strength
and skill of the men who run the machinery
and use the tools. In doing the former, you
sometimes do the latter also, for when the
workman has finer tools, he is led on to attempt
more difficult work, and thus not only does his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
own skill become more perfect, but his interest
in the work is likely to be increased.</p>

<p>Although in politics by far the most real and
lasting progress may be expected from raising
the intelligence and virtue of the citizens, still
improvements in the machinery of government
must not be undervalued. To take away from
bad men the means and opportunities by which
they may work evil, to furnish good men with
means and opportunities which make it easier
for them to prevent or overcome evil, is to
render a great service. And as laws which
breathe a high spirit help to educate the whole
community, so does the presence of opportunities
for reform stimulate and invigorate the
best citizens in their efforts after better things.</p>

<p>I will enumerate briefly some of the remedies
that may be classed as Mechanical because
they consist in alterations of institutions or
methods.</p>

<p>Two of these need only a few passing words,
because they are so sweeping as to involve the
whole fabric of government, and therefore too
large to be discussed here.</p>

<p>One is propounded by those thinkers whom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
to distinguish them from the persons who
announce themselves as enemies of all society,
we may call the Philosophical Anarchists,
thinkers who are entitled to respectful consideration
because their doctrine represents a
protest that needs to be made against the conception
of an all-engulfing State in which individual
initiative and self-guided development
might be merged and lost. They desire to get
rid of the defects of government by getting rid
of government itself; that is to say, by leaving
men entirely alone without any coercive control,
trusting to their natural good impulses to
restrain them from harming one another. In
such a state of things there would be no Citizenship,
properly so called, but only the isolation
of families, or perhaps of individuals—for
it is not quite clear how far the family is
expected to remain in the Anarchist paradise—an
isolation more or less qualified by brotherly
love. We are so far at present from a
prospect of reaching the conditions needed for
such an amelioration that it is enough to note
this view and pass on.</p>

<p>A second and diametrically opposite cure for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the evils of existing society comes from those
who are commonly termed Socialists or Collectivists.
It consists in so widely enlarging the
functions of government as to commit to it not
merely all the work it now performs of defending
the country, maintaining order, enacting
laws, and enforcing justice between man and
man, but also the further work of producing
and distributing all commodities, allotting to
each man his proper labour and proper remuneration,
or possibly, instead of giving any
pecuniary remuneration, providing each man
with what he needs for life. Under this régime
two of the hindrances to good citizenship would
be much reduced. There ought to be less indifference
to politics when everybody’s interest
in the management of public concerns had been
immensely increased by the fact that he found
himself dependent on the public officials for
everything. Nobody could plead that he was
occupied by his own private business, because
his private business would have vanished. So
also selfish personal interest in making gains
out of government must needs disappear when
private property itself had ceased to exist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Whether, however, self-interest might not still
find means of influencing public administration
in ways beneficial to individual cupidity, and
whether personal selfishness might not be even
more dangerous, under such conditions, in
proportion to the extended range and power of
government,—this is another question which
cannot be discussed till some definite scheme
for the allotment of work and of remuneration
(if any) shall have been propounded. Party
Spirit would evidently, in a Collectivistic
State, pass into new forms. It might, however,
become more potent than ever before. But
that again would depend on the kind of scheme
for the reshaping of economic society that had
been adopted.</p>

<p>We may pass from these suggestions for the
extinction, or reconstruction on new lines, of
the existing social and political system to certain
minor devices for improving the structure
and methods of government which have been
put forward as likely to help the citizen to discharge
his duties more efficiently.</p>

<p>One of these is the system of Proportional
Representation. It is argued that if electoral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
areas were created with more than two members
each, and if each elector was either allowed
to vote for a number of candidates less than
the number to be chosen, or was allowed to
concentrate all his votes upon one candidate,
or more, according to the number to be chosen,
two good results would follow. The will of the
electors would be more adequately and exactly
expressed, because the minority, or possibly
more than one minority, as well as the majority,
would have everywhere its representative.
The zeal of the electors would be stimulated,
because in each district a section of opinion
not large enough to have a chance of winning
an election, if there were but one member, and
accordingly now apathetic, because without
hope, would then be roused to organize itself
and to take a warmer interest in public affairs.
The Proportional system is, therefore, advocated
as one of those improvements in machinery
which would react upon the people by
quickening the pulses of public life. Some
experiments have already been made in this
direction. Those tried in England did not win
general approval and have been dropped. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
which is still in operation in the State of Illinois
has not, if my informants are right, given much
satisfaction. But the plan is said to work well
both in Belgium and in some of the cantons
of Switzerland; so one may hope that further
experiments will be attempted. It deserves
your careful study, but it is too complicated
and opens too many side issues to be further
discussed now and here.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Since the above was written a Royal Commission has been
appointed in Britain to examine divers questions relating to
elections, and is investigating this, among other plans.</p>

</div>

<p>Attempts have been made in some places to
overcome the indifference of citizens to their
duty by fining those who, without sufficient
excuse, fail to vote. This plan of Obligatory
Voting, as it is called, finds favour in some
Swiss cantons and in Belgium, but is too
uncongenial to the habits of England or of the
United States to be worth considering as a
practical measure in either country. Moreover,
the neglect to vote is no very serious evil in
either country, at least as regards the more
important elections. Swiss legislation on the
subject is evidence not so much of indifference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
among the citizens of that country as of the
high standard of public duty they are expected
to reach.</p>

<p>When we come to the proposals made both
here and in England for the reference of proposals
to a direct popular vote, we come to a
question of real practical importance. I wish
that I had time to state to you and to examine
the arguments both for and against this mode
of legislation, which has been practised for
many years in Switzerland with a virtually
unanimous approval, and has been applied
pretty freely in some of your States. It has
taken two forms. One is the so-called Initiative,
under which a section of the electors (being a
number, or a proportion, prescribed by law)
may propose a law upon which the people vote.
This is being tried in Switzerland, but so far as
I have been able to gather, has not yet proved
its utility. The balance of skilled opinion
seems to incline against it. The other is called
the Referendum, and consists in the submission
to popular vote of measures already passed by
the legislative body. In this form the reference
of laws to the people undoubtedly sharpens the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
interest of the ordinary citizen in the conduct
of public affairs. The Swiss voters, at any rate,
take pains to inform themselves on the merits
of the measures submitted to them. These are
widely and acutely canvassed at public meetings,
and in the press. A large vote is usually
cast, and all, whether or no they approve the
result, agree that it is an intelligent, not a
heedless, vote. The Swiss do not seem to think
that the power and dignity of the legislature is
weakened, as some might expect it to be, when
their final voice is thus superseded by that of
the people. All I need now ask you to note and
remember is that the practice of bringing political
issues directly before the people, whatever
its drawbacks, does tend to diminish both that
indolence and indifference which is pretty common
among European voters. It requires every
citizen to think for himself and deliver his vote
upon all the more important measures, and it
also reduces the power of that Party Spirit
which everywhere distracts men’s minds from
the real merits of the questions before the
country. When a law is submitted to the Swiss
people for their judgment, their decision nowise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
affects either the Executive or the Legislature.
The law may be rejected by the people, but the
officials who drafted the law continue to hold
office. The party which brought it in and carried
it through the Legislature is not deemed
to have been censured or weakened by the fact
of its ultimate rejection. That party spirit is
less strong in Switzerland than in any other
free country (except perhaps Norway) may be
largely attributed to this disjunction of the
deciding voice in legislation from those governmental
organs which every political party
seeks to control. The Swiss voter is to-day an
exceptionally intelligent and patriotic citizen,
fitter to exercise the function of direct legislation
than perhaps any other citizen in Europe,
and the practice of directly legislating has
doubtless helped to train him for the function.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted that the circumstances
of that little republic and its cantons
are too peculiar to make it safe to draw
inferences from Swiss experience to large countries
like Britain and France, the political life
of which is highly centralized. The States of
your Union may appear to offer a better field,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
and the results of the various experiments
which some of them (such as Oklahoma) are
trying will be watched with interest by Europeans.</p>

<p>In considering the harm done to civic duty by
selfish personal interests we were led to observe
that the fewer points of contact between government
and the pecuniary interests of private
citizens, the better both for the purity of government
and for the conscience of the private
citizen. How far government ought to include
within its functions schemes for increasing
national wealth, otherwise than by such
means (being means which a government alone
can employ because to be effective they must
be done on a great scale) as the improving of
education, the diffusing of knowledge, the providing
means of transportation, the conservation
of natural resources, and so forth, may be
matter for debate. But at any rate government
ought to avoid measures tending to enrich any
one person or group of persons at the expense
of the citizens generally. Common justice
requires that. Accordingly, all contracts should
be made on the terms best for the public, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
possible by open bidding. Franchises, if not
reserved by the public authority for itself,
should be granted only for limited times and so
as to secure the interests of the community,
whether by way of a rent payable to the city or
county treasury or otherwise. Public employees
should not be made into a privileged class,
to which there is given larger pay than other
workers of the same class and capacity receive.
All bills promoted by a private person, firm,
or company looking to his or their pecuniary
advantage ought to be closely scrutinized by
some responsible public authority. In England
we draw a sharp distinction between such bills
and general public legislation, and we submit
the former to a quasi-judicial examination by
a Parliamentary committee in order to avoid
possible jobs or scandals or losses to the public.
As respects general legislation, i. e., that which
is not in its terms local or personal, it may be
difficult or impossible to prevent a law from
incidentally benefiting one group or class of
men and injuring another. But everything that
can be done ought to be done to prevent any
set of men from abusing legislation to serve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
their own interest. If there be truth in what
one hears about the groups which in France,
Belgium, and Germany have, through political
pressure, obtained by law bounties benefiting
their industries, or tariffs specially favourable
to their own commercial enterprises, the danger
that the general taxpayer, or the consumer,
may be sacrificed to these private interests, is a
real danger. To remove the occasion and the
opportunities for the exercise of such pressure,
which is likely to be often exerted in a covert
way and to warp or pervert the legislator’s
mind, is to diminish a temptation and to remove
a stumbling block that lies in the path
of civic duty. Whether a man be in theory a
Protectionist or a Free Trader, whether or not
he desires to nationalize public utilities, he
must recognize the dangers incident to the
passing of laws which influential groups of
wealthy men may have a personal interest in
promoting or resisting, because they offer a
prospect of gain sufficiently large to make it
worth while to “get at” legislatures and officials.
Such dangers arise in all governments.
That which makes them formidable in democracies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
is the fact that the interest of each individual
citizen in protecting himself and the
public against the selfish groups may be so
small an interest that everybody neglects it,
and the groups get their way.</p>

<p>As we have been considering improvements
in the machinery of government, this would be
a fitting place for a discussion of what you call
Primary Election Laws, which are intended
both to reduce the power of party organizations
and to stimulate the personal zeal of the
voter by making it easier for him to influence
the selection of a candidate. We have, however,
in Europe, nothing corresponding to the
Primary Laws of American States, nothing
which recognizes a political party as a concrete
body, nothing which deals with the mode of
selecting candidates; and many of you doubtless
know better than I do what has been
the effect of these American enactments and
whether they have really roused the ordinary
citizen to bestir himself and to assert his independence
of such party organizations as may
have heretofore interfered with it. Europeans
do not take kindly to the notion of giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
statutory recognition to a Party, and they
doubt whether the astuteness of those whom
you call “machine politicians” may not succeed
in getting hold of the new statutory Primaries
as they did of the old ones. Be the merits
of the new legislation what they may, one must
hope that its existence will not induce the
friends of reform to relax their efforts to reduce
in other ways the power of political “Machines.”</p>

<p>One obvious expedient to which good citizens
may resort for keeping other citizens up to the
mark is to be found in the enactment and
enforcement of stringent laws against breaches
of public trust. I took occasion, in referring to
the practices of bribery and treating at elections,
to note the wholesome effect of the statute
passed in England in 1883 for repressing those
offences. Although St. Paul has told us that he
who is under grace does not need to be under
the law, Christianity has not yet gone far
enough to enable any of us to dispense with the
moral force law can exert, both directly through
the penalties it imposes and indirectly through
the type of conduct which it exhorts the community<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
to maintain. Laws may do much to
raise and sustain the tone of all the persons
engaged in public affairs as officials or as legislators,
not only by appealing to their conscience,
but by giving them a quick and easy reply to
those who seek improper favours from them.
A statute may express the best conscience of
the whole people and set the standard they
approve, even where the practice of most individuals
falls short of the standard. If the
prosecuting authorities and the courts do their
duty unflinchingly, without regard to the
social position of the offender, a statute may
bring the practice of ordinary men up to the
level of that collective conscience of the nation
which it embodies.</p>

<p>In every walk of life a class of persons constantly
subject to a particular set of temptations
is apt to form habits, due to the pressure
of those temptations, which are below what
the conscience of the better men in the community
approves. The aim of legislation, as
expressing that best conscience of the whole
community, ought to be to correct or extirpate
those habits and make each particular class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
understand that it is not to be excused because
it has special temptations and thinks its own
sins venial. Even the men who yield to the
temptations peculiar to their own class are
willing to join in condemning those who yield
to some other kind of temptation. Thus the
“better conscience” may succeed in screwing
up one class after another to a higher level.
But the enactment of a law is not enough. It
must be strictly enforced. Procedure must be
prompt. Juries must be firm. Technicalities
must not be suffered to obstruct the march of
justice. Sentences must be carried out, else the
statute will become, as statutes often have
become, a record of aspiration rather than of
accomplishment.</p>

<p>To contrive plans by which the interest of
the citizen in public affairs shall be aroused and
sustained, is far easier than to induce the
citizen to use and to go on using, year in and
year out, the contrivances and opportunities
provided for his benefit. Yet it is from the
heart and will of the citizen that all real and
lasting improvements must proceed. In the
words of the Gospel, it is the inside of the cup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
and platter that must be made clean. The central
problem of civic duty is the ethical problem.
Indifference, selfish interests, the excesses
of party spirit, will all begin to disappear as
civic life is lifted on to a higher plane, and
as the number of those who, standing on that
higher plane, will apply a strict test to their
own conduct and to that of their leaders, realizing
and striving to discharge their responsibilities,
goes on steadily increasing until they
come to form the majority of the people. What
we have called “the better conscience” must
be grafted on to the “wild stock” of the natural
Average Man.</p>

<p>How is this to be done? The difficulty is the
same as that which meets the social reformer
or the preacher of religion.</p>

<p>One must try to reach the Will through the
Soul. The most obvious way to begin is through
the education of those who are to be citizens,
moral education combined with and made the
foundation for instruction in civic duty. This
is a task which the Swiss alone among European
nations seem to have seriously undertaken.
Here in America it has become doubly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
important through the recent entrance into
your community of a vast mass of immigrants,
most of them ignorant of our language, still
more of them ignorant, not only of your institutions,
but of the general principles and habits
of free government. Most of them doubtless
belong to races of high natural intelligence, and
many of them have the simple virtues of the
peasant. You are providing for all of them
good schools, and their children will soon become
Americans in speech and habits, quite
patriotic enough so far as flag-waving goes.
But they will not so soon or so completely
acquire your intellectual and moral standard,
or imbibe your historical and religious traditions.
There is no fear but what they will
quickly learn to vote. To some Europeans you
seem to have been overconfident in intrusting
them with a power which most of them cannot
yet have learned to use wisely. That however
you have done, and as you hold that it cannot
now be undone, your task must now be to teach
them, if you can, to understand your institutions,
to think about the vote they have to
give, and to realize the responsibilities which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the suffrage implies as these were realized
by your New England forefathers when they
planted free commonwealths in the wilderness
nearly three centuries ago.</p>

<p>Valuable as instruction may be in fitting the
citizen to comprehend and judge upon the
issues which his vote determines, there must
also be the will to apply his knowledge for the
public good. What appeal shall be made to
him?</p>

<p>We—I say “we” because this is our task in
Europe no less than it is yours here—we may
appeal to his enlightened self-interest, making
self-interest so enlightened that it loses its
selfish quality. We can remind him of all the
useful work which governments may accomplish
when they are conducted by the right men
in the right spirit. Take, for instance, the work
to be performed in those cities wherein so large
and increasing a part of the population now
dwell. How much remains to be done to make
cities healthier, to secure better dwellings for
the poor, to root out nests of crime, to remove
the temptations to intemperance and gambling,
to bring within the reach of the poorest all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
possible facilities both for intellectual progress
and for enjoying the pleasures of art and music!
How much may we do so to adorn the city
with parks and public buildings as to make its
external aspect instil the sense of beauty into
its inhabitants and give them a fine pride in it!
These are some of the tasks which cannot safely
be intrusted to a municipality unless its government
is above suspicion, unless men of probity
and capacity are placed in power, unless the
whole community extends its sympathy to the
work and keeps a vigilant eye upon all the
officials. Municipal governments cannot be
encouraged to own public utilities so long as
there is a risk that somebody may own municipal
governments. Have we not here a strong
motive for securing purity and efficiency in city
administration? Is it not the personal interest
of every one of us that the city we dwell in
should be such as I have sought to describe?
Nothing makes more for happiness than to see
others around one happy. The rich residents
need not grudge—nor indeed would your rich
residents grudge, for there is less grumbling
among the rich tax payers here than in Europe—taxation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
which they could see was being
honestly spent for the benefit of the city. The
interest each one of us has as a member of
a city or a nation in seeing our fellow-citizens
healthy, peaceful, and happy is a greater interest,
if it be measured in terms of our own
real enjoyment of life, than is that interest, of
which we so constantly are reminded, which we
have in making the State either wealthy by the
development of trade, or formidable to foreign
countries by its armaments.</p>

<p>We may also appeal to every citizen’s sense
of dignity and self-respect. We may bid him
recollect that he is the heir of rights and privileges
which you and our ancestors fought for,
and which place him, whatever his birth or
fortune, among the rulers of his country. He
is unworthy of himself, unmindful of what he
owes to the Constitution that has given him
these functions, if he does not try to discharge
them worthily. These considerations are no
doubt familiar to us Englishmen and Americans,
though we may not always feel their force
as deeply as we ought. To the new immigrants
of whom I have already spoken they are unfamiliar;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
yet to the best among these also they
have sometimes powerfully appealed. You had,
in the last generation, no more high-minded
and patriotic citizen than the German exile of
1849, the late Mr. Carl Schurz.</p>

<p>When every motive has been invoked, and
every expedient applied that can stimulate the
sense of civic duty, one never can feel sure
that the desired result will follow. The moral
reformer and the preacher of religion have the
same experience. The ebbs and flows of ethical
life are beyond the reach of scientific prediction.
There are times of awakening, “times of
refreshing from the presence of the Lord,” as
your Puritan ancestors said, but we do not
know when they will come nor can we explain
why they come just when they do. Every man
can recall moments in his own life when
the sky seemed to open above him, and when
his vision was so quickened that all things
stood transfigured in a purer and brighter radiance,
when duty, and even toil done for the
sake of duty, seemed beautiful and full of
joy.</p>

<p>You remember Wordsworth’s <span class="locked">lines—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Hence, in a season of fair weather,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though inland far we be,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That brought us hither.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we survey the wide field of European history,
we shall find that something like this
happens with nations also. They, too, have
moments of exaltation, moments of depression.
Their ideals rise and fall. They are for a time
filled with a spirit which seeks truth, which
loves honour, which is ready for self-sacrifice;
and after a time the light begins to fade from
the hills and this spirit lingers only among the
best souls.</p>

<p>Such a spirit is sometimes evoked by a great
national crisis which thrills all hearts. This
happened to England or at least to a large part
of the people of England, in the seventeenth
century. It happened to Germany in the days
of the War of Liberation, and to Italy when she
was striving to expel the Austrians and the
petty princes who ruled by Austria’s help. You
here felt it during the War of Secession. Sometimes,
and usually at one of these crises, a great
man stands out who helps to raise the feeling
of his people and inspire them with his own lofty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
thoughts and aims. Such a man was Mazzini,
seventy years ago in Italy. Such were Washington
and Lincoln, the former more by his
example than by his words, the latter by both,
yet most by the quiet patience, dignity, and
hopefulness which he showed in the darkest
hours. Nations respond to the appeal which
such a man makes to their best instincts. He
typifies for the moment whatever is highest in
them.</p>

<p>Unhappily, with nations as with individuals,
there is apt to be a relapse from these loftier
moods into the old common ways when selfish
interest and trivial pleasures resume their sway.
There comes a sort of reaction from the stress
of virtue and strenuous high-soaring effort.
Everything looks gray and dull. The divine
light has died out of the sky. This, too, is an
oft-repeated lesson of European history. Yet
the reaction and decline are not inevitable.
When an individual man has been raised above
himself by some spiritual impulse, he is sometimes
able to hold the ground he has won. His
will may have been strengthened. He has
learnt to control the meaner desires. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
impulse that stirred him is not wholly spent,
because the nobler thoughts and acts which it
prompted have become a habit with him. So,
too, with a nation. What habits are to the
individual man, that, to a nation, are its Traditions.
They are the memories of the Past
turned into the standards of the Present. High
traditions go to form a code of honour, which
speaks with authority to the sense of honour.
Whoever transgresses that code is felt to be
unworthy of the nation, unfit to hold that place
in its respect and confidence which the great
ones of the days of old have held. Pride in the
glorious foretime of the race and in its heroes
sustains in the individual man who is called
to public duty, the personal pride which makes
him feel that all his affections and all his emotions
stand rooted in the sense of honour, which
is, for the man and for the nation, the foundation
of all virtue.</p>

<p>We have seen in our own time, in the people
of Japan, a striking example of what the passionate
attachment to a national ideal can do
in war to intensify the sense of duty and self-sacrifice.
A similar example is held up to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
by those who have recorded the earlier annals
of Rome. The deepest moral they teach is the
splendid power which the love of Rome and the
idea of what her children owed to her exercised
over her great citizens, enabling them to set
shining examples of devotion to the city which
the world has admired ever since. Each example
evoked later examples in later generations,
till at last in a changed community, its upper
class demoralized by wealth and power even
more than it was torn by discord, its lower
classes corrupted by the upper and looking on
their suffrage as a means of gain, the ancient
traditions died out. Whoever, studying the
conditions of modern European democracies,
sees the infinite fatalities which popular government
in large countries full of rich men and of
opportunities for acquiring riches, offers for
the perversion of government to private selfish
ends, will often feel that those European States
which have maintained the highest standard
of civic purity have done it in respect of their
Traditions. Were these to be weakened, the
fabric might crumble into dust.</p>

<p>Every new generation as it comes up can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
make the traditions which it finds better or
worse. If its imagination is touched and its
emotions stirred by all that is finest in the history
of its country, it learns to live up to the
ideals set before it, and thus it strengthens the
best standards of conduct it has inherited and
prolongs the reverence felt for them.</p>

<p>The responsibility for forming ideals and
fixing standards does not belong to statesmen
alone. It belongs, and now perhaps more
largely than ever before, to the intellectual
leaders of the nation, and especially to those
who address the people in the universities and
through the press. Teachers, writers, journalists,
are forming the mind of modern nations
to an extent previously unknown. Here they
have opportunities such as have existed never
before, nor in any other country, for trying to
inspire the nation with a love of truth and
honour, with a sense of the high obligations
of citizenship, and especially of those who hold
public office.</p>

<p>Of the power which the daily press exerts
upon the thought and the tastes of the people
through the matter it scatters among them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and of the grave import of the choice it has
always and everywhere to make between the
serious treatment of public issues and that
cheap cynicism which so many readers find
amusing, there is no need to speak here. You
know better than I do how far those who direct
the press realize and try to discharge the
responsibilities which attach to their power.</p>

<p>The observer who seeks to discern and estimate
the forces working for good or evil that
mark the spirit and tendencies of an age, finds
it easiest to do this by noting the changes which
have occurred within his own memory. To-day
everyone seems to dwell upon the growth not
only of luxury, but of the passion for amusement,
and most of those who can look back
thirty or forty years find in this growth grounds
for discouragement. I deny neither the fact nor
the significance of the auguries that it suggests.
But let us also note a hopeful sign manifest
during the last twenty years both here and in
England. It is the diffusion among the educated
and richer classes of a warmer feeling of
sympathy and a stronger feeling of responsibility
for the less fortunate sections of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
community. There is more of a sense of brotherhood,
more of a desire to help, more of a
discontent with those arrangements of society
which press hardly on the common man than
there was forty years ago. This altruistic spirit
which is now everywhere visible in the field
of private philanthropic work, seems likely to
spread into the field of civic action also, and
may there become a new motive power. It has
already become a more efficient force in legislation
than it ever was before. We may well hope
that it will draw more and more of those who
love and seek to help their fellow-men into
that legislative and administrative work whose
opportunities for grappling with economic and
social problems become every day greater.</p>

<p>Here in America I am told in nearly every
city I visit that the young men are more and
more caring for and bestirring themselves to
discharge their civic duties. That is the best
news one can hear. Surely no country makes so
clear a call upon her citizens to work for her as
yours does. Think of the wide-spreading results
which good solid work produces on so vast
a community, where everything achieved for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
good in one place is quickly known and may
be quickly imitated in another. Think of the
advantages for the development of the highest
civilization which the boundless resources of
your territory provide. Think of that principle
of the Sovereignty of the People which you
have carried further than it was ever carried
before and which requires and inspires and,
indeed, compels you to endeavour to make the
whole people fit to bear a weight and discharge
a task such as no other multitude of men ever
yet undertook. Think of the sense of fraternity,
also without precedent in any other great
nation, which binds all Americans together and
makes it easier here than elsewhere for each
citizen to meet every other citizen as an equal
upon a common ground. One who, coming
from the Old World, remembers the greater
difficulties the Old World has to face, rejoices
to think how much, with all these advantages,
the youth of America, such youth as I see
here to-night in this venerable university, may
accomplish for the future of your country.
Nature has done her best to provide a foundation
whereon the fabric of an enlightened and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
steadily advancing civilization may be reared.
It is for you to build upon that foundation.
Free from many of the dangers that surround
the States of Europe, you have unequalled
opportunities for showing what a high spirit of
citizenship—zealous, intelligent, disinterested—may
do for the happiness and dignity of
a mighty nation, enabling it to become what
its founders hoped it might be—a model
for other peoples more lately emerged into the
sunlight of freedom.</p>
